# RCON Rust

Attempting an RCON library/binary in rust. This is driven by my desire to use this against an ARK: Survival Evolved server so this hasn't been tested against anything else.

This is still in heavy POC phase so if you come across this at this point I would not recommend using it. If I find enough time to properly work on this I will properly license and add a contributors file.
